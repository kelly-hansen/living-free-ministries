                            Deborah and Sheneau Stanley have been married since 1976. They have six children and two wonderful granddaughters.
                            Sheneau writes, <i>“Like many people, we have gone through rough times in our many years (48 years as of this writing) of
                            marriage. This has been our training ground. The books we’ve both read, along with teachings, seminars, small groups and
                            leaders who have poured their love into us, have laid the foundation for our work. No marriage or family is perfect and
                            neither is ours. But we can say that we truly love each other and love being together.”</i>
                        <p>
                            <i>“Our ministry was born out of walking our own lives out through much struggle, grief and pain.” </i> Sheneau and Deborah are
                            both ordained ministers and ‘Pastoral Coaches.’ They believe it is important to bring both the spiritual realities and
                            the practical realities together. They see themselves as a father and mother in the faith, ready to help others grow up
                            to maturity. Sheneau believes, <i>“All things are possible with God. We know this because of all the miracles we have seen
                            in our own lives. What we share is not book knowledge but life knowledge. We know God is real and that He loves you.”</i>

                    from Parts II and III. You are invited to attend any or all of them in any order to experience Freedom and miracles.

                to not feel good enough or qualified enough to teach, speak or lead others. You don’t have to feel that way anymore.
                These seminars will help you be a better father/mother, child, husband/wife, leader and friend. We guarantee the eyes of
                your heart will be opened. Not only will you be free, God will help you to free others too.</p>

                    <p class="mb-4"><i>“Before we got married, my husband and I took Sheneau and Deborah’s Marriage Class. As we both had been married before we felt we needed to learn as much as we could about marriage as this is not taught, and rarely do we have the tools necessary to know how to communicate; we also have unrealistic expectations which we bring into our marriages, and these are based on our own parents’ relationship and the way we were raised. This class was very informational and taught with Sheneau’s incomparable sense of humor. We have taken this class several times over. There is always new material that Sheneau and Deborah bring. I recommend this class to everyone, no matter how long have you been married, or if you’re thinking of getting married. A class like this should be taught in high school; I am sure that it would avoid half of the divorces that occur out of miscommunication, unforgiveness, and pride.”</i></p>

                    <p class="mb-4"><i>“We’ve known the Stanley’s for numerous years and they have always made them-selves available to us. Even on short notice we could always count on them for Godly counsel. We have had the pleasure of knowing the Stanley’s and counseling with them for several years at various times when we’ve needed them. They have a passion for helping people and doing it in a God-pleasing way. It won’t take you long to find they love what they do and take a genuine interest in helping. I was introduced to Sheneau years ago when a prior counselor was unable to continue offering counseling in my area. I was pleased to find how easy he was to talk to and how much he cared. He always made time available and kept Jesus first in everything. He also demonstrated the value of focused prayer and forgiveness when working through issues. I’d recommend Sheneau to anyone who is looking for solid, Godly counsel.”</i></p>

                    <p class="mb-4"><i>“Since relocating our family to OC from the mid-west, we have been blessed to receive counsel and ministry from Sheneau and Deborah. As a husband, father and self-employed businessman, the counsel, wisdom and compassion we have received have been foundational to our being able to adjust to our new life in SoCal. I’m so thankful for the anointing on this couple to bring practical everyday help to the body of Christ.”</i></p>
